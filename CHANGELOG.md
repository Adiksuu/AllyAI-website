## AllyAI Update log

### [v2.0.3] - 2025-03-02
---
#### Added:
- The ability to convert text to speech (message tool) has been introduced; it only works for selected browsers. If you don't hear anything after pressing it, it means that your browser does not support text-to-speech
- I introduced the ability to choose the scale at which we want to receive the image generated by the ALLY-IMAGINE model
- On the chat creation page, at the very bottom we can now find the text about viewing the changelog, it redirects to the .markdown file in the project's github repository
- A completely new and quite popular functionality, i.e. Search Grounding, i.e. the ability to search for information not in an artificial intelligence database but by downloading information from a search engine, AI provides the best and most trusted results

#### Changed:
- The appearance of additional message tools has been changed, now they are displayed only after pressing the tool icon next to the message
- After a long time, I started improving the ALLY-IMAGINE model, now the results obtained are several times better in quality, they look much more real and are not in a cartoon style

#### Fixed:
- There were problems with the order of displaying chats in the chat list, this has already been fixed, hopefully finally

#### Removed:
- Nothing has been deleted
