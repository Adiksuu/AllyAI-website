## AllyAI Update log

### [v2.1.1] - 2025-03-10
---
#### Added:
- At the top of each chat, the date it was created is displayed in a rather **minimalistic** way, which makes it fit into the site's interface
- A subpage **"/event"** has been created, which displays current event tasks and information about the event, when the event is over, information will be provided

#### Changed:
- The **re-generate** response feature has been visually changed, but there are some minor issues with it, so it is now only available after enabling experimental features available in the Premium version
- The **event system has been changed**, from now on the user will not receive the page theme immediately after entering it, but only after completing the designated 3 simple tasks
- Information about a new event will appear immediately when the event starts, when it expires the possibility of receiving the theme will automatically disappear and the notification will disappear, without any changes to the page code

#### Fixed:
- We've fixed a bug that caused **prompts to not reset for several weeks** on accounts that didn't have a Premium plan, my deepest apologies!

#### Removed:
- Nothing has been deleted
